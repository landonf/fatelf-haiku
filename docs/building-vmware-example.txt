- Start vmware workstation.

Do this twice, for amd64 and x86, in separate VMs...Name the amd64 one
 something like "Ubuntu 9.04 FatELF" (this is the one you'll publish) and
 the other something like "Ubuntux86tmp" (this is the one you'll throw away
 at the end).

- Create new VM.
- Use Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop .iso, do easy install,
  realname FatELF, username fatelf, password fatelf.
- Log in after install, fire up a terminal.
- Run update manager, get the latest and greatest. Click "Restart Later"
- System -> Administration -> Login Window -> Security -> Enable Automatic Login
- sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake mercurial openssh-server gcc-multilib
- hg clone http://hg.icculus.org/icculus/fatelf
- cd fatelf
- mkdir cmake-build
- cd cmake-build
- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
- make
- sudo make install
- cd
- scp the fatelf version of Ubuntu .debs to the box (or feel free to spend
  hours patching and building things).
- sudo dpkg -i *.deb
- sudo apt-get autoremove
-  (there's probably a better way to do this next thing.)
- sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/DO_NOT_RUN_APT_UPDATES-sources.list-SERIOUSLY
- Reboot to pick up new kernel.
- sudo /usr/bin/vmware-config-tools.pl
-  (hit enter for all questions.)
- cd fatelf/test
- ./test.sh  (see if anything fails. It shouldn't!)
- sudo rm -f /boot/*-11-* /boot/memtest86+
- Shutdown and put this disk image aside for now.


After both virtual machines are good to go...

- Add the x86 disk to the amd64 VM, so it's /dev/sdb and the amd64 one is sda.
- Boot the amd64 virtual machine from a Ubuntu install .iso, 64 or 32 bit should do.
- "Try Ubuntu without any change to your computer"
- Fire up a terminal.
- sudo mount -t ext3 -r /dev/sda1 /mnt
- cp -av /mnt/home/fatelf/fatelf .
- sudo umount /mnt
- cd fatelf/merge
- Consider setting a vmware snapshot, here.
- sudo ./merge.sh
- Pray everything worked, or all this time was wasted.
- Shut down the VM.
- Remove the .iso ... switch back to physical CD/DVD drive.
- Restart the vm, edit the grub command line to boot from the x86 disk,
  with root=/dev/sdb1.
- Fire up a terminal.
- sudo mount -t ext3 /dev/sda1 /mnt
- Run sudo vmware-toolbox and shrink the virtual disk at /mnt.
- sudo umount /mnt
- Shut down.
- Remove the x86 disk. Delete the x86 disk and VM. You're done with them.
- Zip up the vmware files and start to upload.
- Restart the remaining VM, make sure it worked, so you know if you have to
  stop the upload. Should be able to choose x86 or amd64 from the grub menu
  now.
- Shutdown.
- You're done!
