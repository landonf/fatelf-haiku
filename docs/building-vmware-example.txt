- Start vmware workstation.

Do this twice, for amd64 and x86, in separate VMs...

- Create new VM.
- Use Ubuntu 9.04 Desktop .iso, do easy install,
  realname FatELF, username fatelf, password fatelf.
- Log in after install, fire up a terminal.
- Run update manager, get the latest and greatest.
- System -> Administration -> Login Window -> Security -> Enable Automatic Login
- sudo apt-get install build-essential cmake mercurial openssh-server gcc-multilib
- hg clone http://hg.icculus.org/icculus/fatelf
- cd fatelf
- mkdir cmake-build
- cd cmake-build
- cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Release ..
- make
- sudo make install
- cd
- scp the fatelf version of Ubuntu .debs to the box (or feel free to spend
  hours patching and building things).
- sudo dpkg -i *.deb
- sudo apt-get autoremove
-  (there's probably a better way to do this next thing.)
- sudo mv /etc/apt/sources.list /etc/apt/DO_NOT_RUN_APT_UPDATES-sources.list-SERIOUSLY
- sudo rm /boot/*-11-* /boot/memtest86+
- Reboot to pick up new kernel.
- cd fatelf/test
- ./test.sh  (see if anything fails. It shouldn't!)
- Shutdown and put this disk image aside for now.


After both machines are good to go...

- Add the x86 disk to the amd64 VM, so it's /dev/sdb and the amd64 one is sda.
- Boot the amd64 virtual machine from a Ubuntu install .iso, 64 or 32 bit should do.
- "Try Ubuntu without installing"
- Fire up a terminal.
- sudo mount -t ext3 -r /dev/sda1 /mnt
- cp -av /mnt/home/fatelf/fatelf .
- sudo umount /mnt
- cd fatelf/misc
- Consider setting a vmware snapshot, here.
- sudo ./merge.sh
- Pray everything worked, or all this time was wasted.
- Shut down the VM, remove the x86 disk. Delete the x86 disk and VM.
- Restart it, see if it worked.
- Run vmware-toolbox and shrink the virtual disk.
- Shutdown.
- Zip up the vmware files and upload.
